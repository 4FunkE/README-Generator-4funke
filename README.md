# README Generator-4funke

  ## Description
  I created this project to make it easier for developers to create a professional README for their finished Repos. The application lets users answer important questions about their repos and then will generate a professionally formatted README to use. It solves the time-consuming effort of creating a README from scratch. I learned how to use node.js to use the integrated terminal and inquirer to create new files.
