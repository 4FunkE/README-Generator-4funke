  ## Description
  I created this project to make it easier for developers to create a professional README for their finished Repos. The projects lets users answer important questions about their repos and then will generator a professionall formatted README to use. It solves the times consuming effort of creating a README from scratch. I learned how to use node.js to use the intergrated terminal and inquirer to create new files.
